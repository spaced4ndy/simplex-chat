# Release regression: iOS

## On iOS, for these cases

- In this run results go to `record`, not to a Results table: skip the Results table and the `todo` rows that "The report" above describes; `report.md` holds only the line on the app at the start, `## Findings` and `## Harness notes`.
- **Give the app a link:** `ui clipboard '<link>'`, then paste it where the case says: in the search field (tap it once to focus it, once more for its menu, then "Paste"), or "Compose" → "Scan / Paste link" → "Tap to paste link" (tap "Allow Paste" if iOS asks). `ui open-link '<link>'` opens a link as another app would.
- **Get a link from the app:** its "Copy" button, or "Share link" and "Copy" in the share sheet; then `ui clipboard` prints it.
- A message's menu: `ui long-press` on the message's text; a chat's actions in the list: swipe its row (`ui swipe`) or long-press it.

## The regression cases

The cases of this session (the table at the end) come from the team's release regression table: each is one line written for a person who knows the app, not a list of steps. For each case, work out the shortest way to check what it says in this app, do it, check it, and record the result at once.

1. Read the case. Where it names a gesture of another platform ("swipe (ios) / long press (android)"), use this app's own way to do the same. A case about a version upgrade, a camera, a microphone, a call, push notifications, a second device, a purchase or a badge code is `manual`: record what it needs. Where only a part of a case needs such a thing, check the rest, and say in the note which part was not checked.
2. Set up what the case needs: contacts, groups and channel subscribers are CLI peers (below); messages, settings and profiles you make in the app.
3. Do it, and check each thing the case says. Take `ui shot <row>-<what>` at the moment that shows the result (the name has only letters, digits, - and _).
4. Record it: `record <row> <ok|bug|blocked|manual> "<what you saw, in one line>" <screenshot name>`.
   - ok: everything the case says held, as you saw it.
   - bug: the app did something wrong; the note says what you did, what you saw and what you expected.
   - blocked: this runner or a helper stopped the case (say what: the peer couldn't connect, the screen couldn't be read, the app crashed at start).
   - manual: the case needs something no runner has; say what.
5. Spend at most about 20 turns on one case: when it is stuck, record it `blocked` with what stopped it, and go on.

Run the cases in the table's order, but leave to the end any case that wipes the app (deleting the database, a self-destruct passcode, deleting the last profile), since the cases after it would start from nothing.

After the last case, run each case recorded `bug` once more, from the start of its steps: record it again, `bug` if it failed again, or `ok` with "passed on retry; first attempt: <what happened>". A case is a bug only after it failed twice.

`report.md` in your directory: one line on the app at the start, `## Findings` with each bug in detail (steps, what you saw, what you expected, screenshots) and `## Harness notes` for anything about the helpers or the runner that got in the way. Results go only to `record`; `record` alone prints what is recorded, so after the conversation has been compacted, run it to see which cases are left, and read `prompt.md` again for the rest.

The session is done when every case of the table is recorded. Your final message: the counts of ok, bug, blocked and manual, and the most important bug, then one more line: `CLAUDE-TEST: PASS` if no case is recorded bug, otherwise `CLAUDE-TEST: FAIL` and the rows recorded bug.

## Peers: the other people in a case

The `peer` helper runs CLI clients that act as contacts, group members and channel subscribers. Name each after a person (alice, bob, carol, dave, eve, …); a peer keeps its contacts, groups and messages for the whole session, so use new names when a case needs people who don't know the app yet. The app's profile is "citester": that is the name peers know it by.

- **A peer is online only while one of its commands runs.** What the app sends while it is offline reaches it at its next command. So after the app does something a peer must answer (accept a connection, join, deliver, read), run `peer <name> wait 20`, or `peer <name> messages '@citester'` to see what arrived. A group the app joins from a peer's link or invitation needs the peer, its host, online: run `peer <host> wait 30` after the app joins.
- **The app connects to a peer:** `peer alice link` (a 1-time link) or `peer alice address` prints a link; give it to the app (below), then `peer alice wait 20` so the connection completes; the app then shows the contact alice.
- **A peer connects to the app:** make a link in the app (1-time link, address, group link, channel link), get its text (below), then `peer bob connect '<link>'`; accept in the app if it asks, then `peer bob wait 20`.
- **Groups:** the app creates the group and adds peer contacts (`peer bob join '#<group>'` accepts the invitation, then `peer bob wait 20`), or a peer creates one (`peer bob group team`, `peer bob invite '#team' '@citester'`) and the app accepts.
- **Channels:** the app's channels use the preset chat relays; a peer joins one by its link (`peer bob connect '<channel link>'`) and is a subscriber. To see a channel as a subscriber in the app itself (signatures, "signature missing", the subscriber's views), add a second profile in the app and join the channel from it by the same link.
- **Messages from peers:** `peer bob send '@citester' 'hello'`; several arguments make a multi-line message; `image`, `file`, `text-file` and `voice` send attachments; `reply`, `react`, `edit`, `delete` act on messages by their text.
- Quote every argument that starts with # or @ or contains spaces or punctuation: `peer bob send '#team' 'hi (all)'`.

## Cases

| Row | Section | Case |
|---|---|---|
| 362 | files | tap file while it is being received - opens when received |
| 490 | groups | auto-accept group invitations (Privacy & security -> Auto-accept -> Group invitations), per profile - joined automatically |
| 491 | groups | invitation to another group sent to group member (CLI) - shown as "For you only", can be accepted: CLI creates groups g1 (direct messages allowed) and g2, app user joins g1; in CLI `/i #g1 <app user>` (g1 group ID, member ID), `/i #g2` (g2 group ID), `/_add #<g2 ID> #<g1 ID> <member ID> member` - app gets invitation to g2 in g1 marked "For you only", accepts, joins g2 |
| 513 | channels | owner makes subscriber moderator - member info shows Moderator; moderator sees subscribers list |
| 514 | channels | moderator deletes message for all - deleted for all subscribers |
| 515 | channels | owner turns on Sign messages (channel preferences) - confirmation alert; new messages show signature mark, item info shows "Signed & verified" |
| 516 | channels | subscriber who joins after signing is turned on sees "signature missing" on earlier messages, tap shows alert |
| 700 | supporter badges | Support SimpleX opens from chat list banner and from settings; "How badges protect your privacy" opens |
| 701 | supporter badges | chat list banner - close button appears only after banner was opened |
| 703 | supporter badges | redeem wrong code / already used code - clear error, not generic failure |
| 707 | supporter badges | ios: "Choose your badge" opens badge page in browser; no in-app purchase, no Restore purchases |
